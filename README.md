## üîç About Me

Experienced cybersecurity professional and educator with strong technical skills in digital forensics, incident response, and IT support. Currently serving as a Cybersecurity Instructor focused on developing the next generation of security professionals. I'm passionate about cybersecurity education, digital forensics, and creating resources that make complex security concepts accessible to all learners.

When I'm not teaching or securing digital assets, I enjoy traveling, photography, videography, graphic design, and disc jockeying. I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the cybersecurity community.
